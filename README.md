# Learning Python
I was avoiding learning python for so long but recently a friend has told me some of the cool things you can do with it. 
So I took it to Google and had a quick look at few things that people have made using python and it looks like it's a very simple but powerful language. 
It help a lot with automation and I thought to myself it would be really handy if I could automate some of the things I do on daily basis.

So I started learning!

Here you will be able to view all of my completed code for each of the "projects" I'm going to make while learning python.
