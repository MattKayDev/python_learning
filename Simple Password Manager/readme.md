# Simple Password Manager

This project started off as a very simple password manager which holds passwords and encrypts them using fernet but as I continued on building it became more complicated.

So I decided to put the simple version here in the python_learning repo and create a standalone repo just for the password manager because it will continue to grow and it will be best to keep track of it there rather than mix it up with other "projects" which goal is only to learn python.
